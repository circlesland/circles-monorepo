# Circles Electron Host

## How it works?

The `electron-host` app will require the `@circlesland/frame-app` as a dependency and build together the full production app. All the host specific APIs will be injected into the `window` object.

## Getting Started

Check the [@circlesland/frame-app](https://github.com/circlesland/frame-app) README for getting started.
