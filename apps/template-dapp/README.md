# Template DApp

This template should help you get started developing new DApps using Svelte and Typescript in Vite.

# Setup

1. Copy this directory under <root>/apps
2. Open the `package.json` file and update the name to your desired application name. You can add extra package dependencies as required by your specific Dapp in this file.
3. You are now ready to go

# Development

Run `npm run dev` in the app directory to start the application server. The server listens for changes and refreshes the application in the browser when you change files. You might have to change the default port 

# Testing
Run `npm run test` in the app directory to run unit tests. Unit tests are written using `jest`. There is a sample test file under `/lib/Counter.test.ts` that you can use as a reference.


# Build

Run `npm run build` to build the application. The binaries will be located in the `dist` directory after the build is finished.
